<h1>Caide Alvarez</h1>

<p>
My creative statement is about allowing others to see life the way I see it.
Growing up in New York has been one of the most eye-opening experiences because
I have had the chance to see life in a multitude of ways. Being surrounded by
so many different cultures, languages, and perspectives has shaped how I think
and how I express myself. Through my work, I want to share that perspective
and help others notice the beauty in everyday life.
