Being born and raised in New York City, I want my website to reflect the diversity, energy, and vibrancy that the city offers. Growing up surrounded by different perspectives, and creative expression has strongly influenced my work.Through this site, I I’m going to showcase the liveliness of New York City and how it continues to shape my creative identity.
