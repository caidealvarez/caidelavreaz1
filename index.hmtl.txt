    <h1>Caide Alvarez</h1>
    <p>
        I want to show others my life through my eyes so they can better understand my way of thinking and how I approach things.
        Since I was little, I've always loved taking pictures and reading, and I'm hoping to combine these two interests on this website
        so others can see and experience that as well.
