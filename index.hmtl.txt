<h1>Caide Alvarez</h1>
<p>TI want to show others my life through my eyes so they can better understand my way of thinking and how I approach things. Since I was little, I've always loved taking pictures and reading, and I'm hoping to combine these two interests on this website so others can see and experience that as well.
